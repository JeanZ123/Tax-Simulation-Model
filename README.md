# Tax-Simulation-Model
The SPSS and R syntax files found in this repository are part of an academic project for simulating the distributional effects of reforms of the German income tax system on different subgroups of the population.

Calculations are made for five reform scenarios:

1. Reform scenario proposed by the German Liberal Party (FDP)
2. Reform scenario advanced by the German Socialist Party (Die Linke)
3. Flat tax scenario
4. Reduction of the German Solidarity Tax (Solidarit√§tszuschlag)
5. Abolition of the German Solidarity Tax

Calculations are based on the 10%-sample of the income tax database (with a total of approx. 4 mio. data rows and over 1,000 variables) produced by the German Statistical Bureau (see: https://www.forschungsdatenzentrum.de/de/10-21242-73111-2014-00-00-3-1-0)
